# IBM-HR-Data-analysis
IBM HR Dashboards Project
•	The lack of awareness among senior management on the performance of the Human Resources department.
•	To solve these problems I've designed three Excel dashboards for the CXOs, and the Retention and Compensation teams. The KPIs I analyzed were Attrition rate, gender neutrality, and percentage of new hire retention.
•	I found out that the company is not gender-neutral, the percentage of new hire retention is 72.70% and the Attrition rate is 15.82%.
